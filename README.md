## About me

Jakub Heba is a cybersecurity expert with almost seven years of experience in the industry. For two years associated with blockchain technology as a Smart Contract and Blockchain auditor. He has conducted over 35 audits of various protocols, mostly related to Decentralized Finances. He specializes in the security of contracts written in Rust, in technologies such as CosmWasm, NEAR, Ink!, Substrate, Scrypto or MultiversX (Elrond), AssemblyScript (Massa), as well as has a deep technical understanding of EVM and Solidity. He participated in assessments testing low-level aspects of blockchain technology, such as finality proof verifications, serialization libraries, as well as implementations of bridges between many different ecosystems. He has experience in auditing Layer 1 Blockchains written in Rust and MOVE. Additionally, he has experience in testing offchain components such as wallets and Metamask Snaps. Before moving to Web3, he was a Lead Security Researcher and Penetration Tester managing a team of up to 10 engineers.
